First I started with database configuration on aws
Database endpoint:udagram-1.cojokxty5mbd.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com

Secondly, I started to deploy the frontend through S3 Bucket, edited the policy and created user with admin access.
Bucket link: http://mohab-udagram.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

Lastly, I had to deploy the backend server to serve the frontend one and we did that through Elastic beantalk
